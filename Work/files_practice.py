# =============================================================================
# Now that you know how to read a file, letâ€™s write a program to perform a simple 
# calculation.
# The columns in portfolio.csv correspond to the stock name, number of shares, and 
# purchase price of a single stock holding. Write a program called pcost.py that 
# opens this file, reads all lines, and calculates how much it cost to purchase 
# all of the shares in the portfolio.
# Hint: to convert a string to an integer, use int(s). To convert a string to a 
# floating point, use float(s).
# 
# Your program should print output such as the following:
# 
# Total cost 44671.15
